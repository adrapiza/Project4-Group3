Predicting San Francisco's Employee Salaries 

Our goal is to look at the different city job titles that are within the city government and prediciting their continous salary values. With using Kaggle's San Francisco's Salary Dataset - we wanted to look into what future salaries may look like for different postions within city deparments. This project would give those who are interested in working for the city of San Francisco and potential salary values for those intrigued in certain positions. The dataset entails job titles, departments, base pay, overtime pay and total compensation. This project would help create decisions around advancement in careers, hiring and keeping employees. We hope to create a predictive model that provides the current salaries of these job titles and also future salaries. 

In this project: 
- Create a predictive model that produces an estimate total of salaries of those who work for the SF City Government based on job titles, their deparments, base pay and other factors
- Use the models to make sure the accuracy of the predcitive model
