# SF Nurses: Full Time Vs Par Time 
---
## Introduction

In this project, we investigate the impact of employment status on nurse salaries in San Francisco, using data from 2014. We chose to focus on nurses because they are always in demand, frequently hiring, and play a crucial role in healthcare. Through data analysis and various modeling techniques, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers, we explore whether employment status significantly impacts nurse salaries in San Francisco. The findings will not only contribute to a better understanding of salary structures in nursing but also support decision-making for potential nurses and healthcare administrators.
